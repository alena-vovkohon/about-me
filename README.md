# about-me

Alona Vovkohon
I'm a starting as junior Web-developer. I like creating and see the result of my work. I have little experience in this sphere, but my life taught me to learn quickly. I'm persistent and purposeful. I like to write clear code with applying interesting solutions. I always make effort to improve myself.
